    <h1>Age Group Sensitivity for COVID-19 Infections Forecasting using Deep Learning</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for 
      governments and healthcare systems worldwide, highlighting the 
      critical importance of understanding the factors that contribute 
      to virus transmission. This study aimed to identify the most 
      influential age groups in COVID-19 infection rates at the US county 
      level using the Modified Morris Method and deep learning for 
      time series. Our approach involved training the state-of-the-art 
      time-series model Temporal Fusion Transformer on different age 
      groups as a static feature and the population vaccination status 
      as the dynamic feature. We analyzed the impact of those age groups 
      on COVID-19 infection rates by perturbing individual input features 
      and ranked them based on their Morris sensitivity scores, which 
      quantify their contribution to COVID-19 transmission rates. 
      The findings are verified using ground truth data from the CDC and 
      US Census, which provide the true infection rates for each age group.
      The results suggest that young adults were the most influential age 
      group in COVID-19 transmission at the county level between March 1, 
      2020, and November 27, 2021. Using these results can inform public 
      health policies and interventions, such as targeted vaccination 
      strategies, to better control the spread of the virus. Our approach 
      demonstrates the utility of feature sensitivity analysis in 
      identifying critical factors contributing to COVID-19 transmission 
      and can be applied in other public health domains.
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges 
    for governments and healthcare systems worldwide, 
    highlighting the need for effective measures to manage and 
    control the virus's spread. Understanding the factors that 
    contribute to disease transmission is crucial for developing 
    targeted public health policies and interventions. <br>

    Age is a critical factor in COVID-19 transmission as shown by previous studies. 
    Many prior works have studied forecasting COVID-19 infection 
    and mortality rates using different statistical, autoregressive
    machine learning, and deep learning models.<br> 
    
    The focus of these models is to make better predictions for 
    the epidemic spread which would help take better mitigation 
    steps. Interpreting how these models make these predictions 
    can provide an understanding of the importance of these 
    different input factors and their interactions. <br>
    
    Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) <a href="#1">[1]</a> is a state-of-the-art 
    forecasting model that has been widely used to do 
    multivariate multi-horizon forecasting. TFT is particularly 
    useful for modeling complex, non-linear relationships 
    between input features and target variables, 
    making it an ideal tool for analyzing COVID-19 transmission 
    patterns. <br><br>

    The Morris method has been widely used to perform sensitivity 
    analysis of different models. By calculating the output change 
    w.r.t input perturbation, the Morris method provides a simple 
    approach to rank input factors by their sensitivity. <br>
  
    By combining TFT with feature sensitivity analysis, we can 
    gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute 
    to COVID-19 transmission and develop more effective strategies 
    to control the spread of the virus. <br>

    In this work, we collected the population by age subgroups 
    data for each of the 3,142 US counties, along  with the daily 
    vaccination rate of the population and COVID-19 case report 
    from March 1, 2020, to Dec 27, 2021. While there are prior 
    studies that observe COVID-19 trends for different age groups, 
    we trained a TFT model on the dataset separately on each age 
    subgroup as the static covariate and then calculated the 
    sensitivity of those models using a modified Morris method. <br><br>

    We then ranked the age groups based on their Morris sensitivity 
    scores to identify the most influential factors contributing 
    to COVID-19 transmission. Finally, we evaluated our age group 
    sensitivity rank with the actual COVID-19 cases reported for 
    those age groups in the same time period. 
    Our study aims to provide insights into the age-related factors 
    that contribute to COVID-19 transmission and inform targeted 
    interventions to control the spread of the virus.

  <h2>Morris Method</h2>
  Morris method <a href="#2">[2]</a> is a reliable and efficient sensitivity 
  analysis method that defines the sensitivity of a model input as the ratio 
  of the change in an output variable to the change in an input feature. 
  Given a model f(.), and a set of k input features, the Morris sensitivity 
  of a model input feature can be defined. 

  <h2> The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)</h2>
    The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) <a href="#1">[1]</a> is a novel, interpretable, 
    attention-based deep learning model for multi-horizon forecasting. Its architecture is 
    carefully designed to handle static (e.g. percentage of age group in a county 
    population), past observed, and known future (e.g. day of the week) inputs.  
    Its architecture is specially modified for four main uses. 
    1) To learn both local and global time-varying relationships at different 
    scales. 2) To filter out input noises using Variable Selection Network (VSN).
    3) To incorporate static metadata into the dynamic features for temporal 
    forecasting. 4) To efficiently use different parts of the network through a
    gating mechanism. On a wide range of real-world tasks, TFT achieves 
    state-of-the-art performance. Hence we use the model for our own study 
    here.

    eight age group related static features, one dynamic feature and one known future feature.

  <h2> Model Training and Prediction</h2>
    A separate TFT model was trained for each age group, for a total 
    of eight models. Since all static variables are presented together 
    as context vectors, the separation ensures the identification of 
    a specific subgroup's contribution without the interference of other 
    correlated static variables. In addition to the static age feature, 
    all TFT models include a dynamic vaccination status feature. <br>

    <img style="max-width: 1000px;" class="center" src="images/Sensitivity Analysis workflow.png">
    <h4>Fig. 2: Workflow of Population Age Group Sensitivity Analysis for COVID-19 Forecasts.</h4>
    <br>
    
    An additional variable SinWeekly is also included, which represents 
    weekly trends for changes in the number of new cases. 
    The target variable for each model was the daily number of cases 
    for each county. The daily predictions for each county were determined 
    for the training, validation, and testing time periods. These predictions 
    were compared to the observed values to obtain RMSE values. 
    
  <h2>Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Next, our Modified Morris Method was applied to each model. 
    This involved perturbing the age feature in each model by a 
    range of positive and negative delta values. The chosen values 
    ranged from -0.01 to 0.01 with steps of 0.001, disregarding the 
    delta value equal to zero. The Morris indices for each of the delta 
    values are shown below. Positive and negative values of delta indicate 
    an increase and decrease in the age feature, respectively. Investigating 
    both an increase and decrease in these features allowed for an 
    understanding of how the Morris indices change between different delta 
    values. Our results show that the Morris values are approximately stable 
    for each age group across a range of values. <br>
    
    Another observation about these results is the magnitude of the Morris 
    values. With the delta and Morris values shown at the same scale of 10^-4,
    the Morris values remain about two to three orders of magnitude smaller 
    than the delta values. This means that the changes caused by the 
    perturbation of the static variable result in small changes in the 
    predictions of the models, indicating a non-linear relationship between 
    the static input and the output.
  <br><br>

    </h4>
  </caption>
  <br>

    Despite the relatively small values, there is a clear distinction 
    between which age groups have higher Morris indices on average. 
    This separation allowed us to rank the age groups based on their 
    sensitivity to the models. Before this was done, it was necessary 
    to obtain a ground truth ranking to use for verification of our 
    ranking derived from the Morris method. <br><br>
      
    Data were obtained from the CDC for the total number of COVID-19 
    cases reported for each age group within the time period of the 
    training set. Data from the US Census were also obtained to 
    provide an estimate of the total population of each age group, 
    with the estimate made for April 1, 2020. Having both the cases 
    and the estimated population allowed us to calculate the true 
    ranking. This was done by calculating the percentage of people in 
    each age group who were infected. For example, 10,018,923 cases 
    were reported for the age group 18-29, with an estimated population 
    of 54,992,661 for that age group. This results in an infection rate 
    of 18.2 percent. The infection rates for all age groups are shown below: <br><br>

    Based on the infection rate within each age subgroup, a ranking was made 
    ranging from 1, the age group with the lowest infection rate, to 8, 
    the age group with the highest infection rate. A ranking of the sensitivity 
    of the model to each age feature was also determined by first ranking the relative 
    Morris values for each age group for a given delta to obtain a ranking from 1 
    (lowest) to 8 (highest) value. After ranking each subgroup for all 20 delta values, 
    the average ranking was determined.<br><br>

    Since the average Morris ranking for the age groups 30-39 and 75+ were found to be 
    identical, we chose to break the tie arbitrarily. We noticed that the 5-17 age group 
    ranking of 2 was significantly different from the ground truth ranking of 7. 
    However, our results indicate that the Morris ranking closely matches the ground 
    truth ranking for the other seven age groups, as most ranks are identical or have 
    a difference of 1 to 3. This is interpreted as indicating that our predictions of 
    which age groups contribute most to the total COVID-19 case numbers during the 
    time period of the data are approximately equal to the true values verified by 
    CDC and US Census data.

  <h2> Related Work</h2>
  <p>
    Numerous works have been done on COVID-19 forecasting using deep learning 
    and other AI or statistical models. Understanding the feature importance 
    and interaction of the input factors is crucial to the adaptation of control measures based on the changing dynamics of the pandemic.

Prior work involved simulation of the spread of COVID-19 using a fractal-fractional model and used sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of model parameters such as the transmission rate, recovery rate, and vaccination rate on the outcomes of the model. Other work investigated the impact of key model parameters on the outcomes of a Susceptible-Carrier-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SCEIR) model predicting COVID-19 infection. Similarly, additional work analyzed the demographic patterns of COVID-19 cases during the recent resurgence of the pandemic in the United States. The data, consisting of 948 counties, studies the age distribution of cases and their relationship with changes in COVID-19 incidence.</p>
    
  <h2> Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
    Typically, deep learning lacks sufficient interpretability to understand the 
    decisions a model makes to improve predictive performance. However, our work 
    demonstrates the successful application of the Morris method. By analyzing model 
    sensitivity to changes in the age input feature, we explained the impact of COVID-19 
    on various age group populations in the US between the time period of March 1, 2020 
    to November 27, 2021. Small perturbations in the static features showed that our models 
    were most sensitive to the 18-29, 30-39, and 40-49 age groups, indicating that these 
    groups contributed most to the total number of COVID-19 cases. These results were then 
    verified by comparison to the ground truth from CDC and Census data. <br>

  After demonstrating the effectiveness of the Morris method applied to deep learning 
  models for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on different age groups, we intend 
  for future experiments to center on exploring the temporal component of these predictions. 
  CDC data show that the ranking of COVID-19 infection rates by age group changes over time. 
  By training new TFT models for a variety of time periods, we can better understand how the 
  impact of COVID-19 varies throughout the pandemic and can further strengthen the reliability 
  of our methods.
