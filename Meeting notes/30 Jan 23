Mon, 30 Jan 23 meeting

Goals:

Understand feature importance
Understand the problem
Rural vs Metro counties
Other variables besides age/occupation/etc

Judy suggestions:

-Everyone should be able to run thru model fitting (top 50/100 counties data set) to gain better problem understanding.
-By next week: let's have design of feature engineering. Run model then observe/analyze differences and refine modeling to run on different features

To contribute to paper:
-Focus on sensitivity analysis; previous paper is not that robust in this regard
-Need to systematically interpret insights from previous modeling
-Previous paper segments based on job sector; we should expand
-More experiments needed; 
-If you use different training periods temporally, will get wildly different predictions; need to be able to explain this
-Modifying training period falls under feature engineering, not really hyper parameters
-Need to scope desired granularity for predictions; are we trying to predict waves, are we trying to predict long-term?
	-Point of interest is county level group aggregate effect. We are trying to predict at the county level to inform health policy decisions/resource allocation

Expanding on sensitivity analysis:
-Deep learning typically a black box; you fit and get result, but interior is a lot of feature reduction and dimensionality reduction. Very hard to get impact of individual feature
-Morris method: run model with deltas in inputs, see change in outputs
-Individual feature analysis
-Challenge of deep learning: nonlinearity, you don't know what impact features has.
Our task is to cut thru the nonlinear noise and figure out actual impacts of individual features. 

-Morris method expansion: you have a vector of perturbations for each feature (changing over time series, changing over location space)

-Sensitivity analysis will use trained model, so not too bad for computational expense

Ex: subgroup of 28/29 year olds as static variable, and put in vaccination rate. Then input perturbation

Morris index not comparable across models

Can do different variables, can do different combinations. Up to us to select features.

Good research question? Mobility/density? JF open to any question, but need to make sure it's interesting and insightful.

Think of tentative question before running models, but need to do some EDA
