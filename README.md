# MLCommons: Understanding Time-Series Deep Learning with Benchmarking

### Project Overview
MLCommons involve a major effort of 52 companies to produce benchmarks with ongoing challenges of Deep Learning applications. MLCommons aims to accelerate machine learning innovation to benefit everyone via benchmarking, datasets and best practices. Our work aims to benchmark an Integrative Deep Learning Framework for COVID-19 Forecasting with Population Covariates. We first do a deeper dive into the data. With 3142 counties, 2 target variables, and a number of static and dynamic features. We look for outliers and clean the data. Using processed data, we compare the LSTM based model from AICov with Google Transformer (TFT) to model Covid deaths and cases across the 500 largest counties in the US.  One study is to detect changepoints in the time series of these variables for the counties within each stratum to identify where the correlation structure changes and study the nature of such change. We are interested in daily time series. Another study looks at static variables such as the workplace nature of a county or its ratio of ethnic groups and see how the model is sensitive to these features. We are making the powerful deep learning methods interpretable.
